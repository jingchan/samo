I'm working on the initial prototyping of an image browsing app where a user can
select a directory and easily browse through the images of that directory. This
app is using electron, vite, vue, typescript and will follow the most up to date
best practices and follow generally good coding conventions. This app should
provide a great user experience while being very performant. It should also be
modular and extensible.

Give me a thorough list of IPC messages should I expect to need for this app.
Please show me what that would look like and give me a good foundation for
organizing them. Also provide the ideal set of strings that would be used for
each of them for the ipc handling functions.
